# 🚀 nestjs-essentials

> A collection of practical **NestJS starter-labs**, organized in folders to help you master and reuse essential backend patterns.

---

## 📚 What is This?

`nestjs-essentials` is not a single project — it’s a **modular lab environment**. Each folder inside the repository is a self-contained **starter lab** focusing on one key aspect of backend development with NestJS.

These labs are designed to be:

- ✅ **Isolated**: Each folder contains a working example with minimal dependencies.
- 🧠 **Educational**: Learn-by-doing format with real-world use cases.
- ♻️ **Reusable**: Copy and adapt patterns into your own NestJS projects.
- 🧱 **Composable**: Combine them as building blocks for larger applications.
